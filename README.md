# Arduino-program-

/*ALL THE PROGRAM IS DONE BY DARIO LOBOS, I TOOK SOME PARTS FROM EXAMPLES, 1O/MAR/2025
 * THE PROGRAM IS TO CONTROL 3 DEVICES TO CHARGE A BATTERY.
 * 
 * DEVICE 1: IS A TRANSFORMER WITH A RECTIFIER TO HAVE DC CURRENT AND ELECTRICITY COMES FROM 
 * THE POWER SUPPLY NET. THIS CAN CHARGE AFTER A TIME SET BY THE USER. TO CHARGE BATTERY WHEN 
 * THE OTHER DEVICES DON'T REACH THE NEEDED FOR ALL NIGHT. CAN DE SET WITHOUT TIME AND BATTERY 
 * WILL BE CHARGED ALL THE DAY. BY SETTING 23:59 WILL NEVER CHARGE (OR JUST A MINUTE). I WILL 
 * ADD THE OPTION TO DISABLE BUT FOR DISABLES CAN BE DISCONNECTED,
 * 
 * 
 * DEVICE 2: IS A SOLAR PANEL THIS CHARGE WHEN BATTERY DON'T REACH THE MAXIMUN CHARGE AND WHEN
 * A PHOTO RESISTO DETERMINE THAT LIGHT IS ENOUGH TO PRODUCE CURRENT, IF NOT IS DISCONNECTED. 
 * ALSO IF VOLTAGE PRODUCED IS LEES THAN BATTERY IS DISCONNECTED, 
 * PHOTO RESISTOR VALUE CAN BE SET UP BY CONSTANT "PHOTO_PRESISTOR_LIMIT" IN THE CODE.
 * 
 * DEVICE 3: IS A WIND TURBINE AND THE ONLY RESTRICTION ARE BATTERY VOLTAGE AND DEVICE VOLTAGE.
 * 
 * I DID A MOSFET CIRCUIT FOR THIS SYSTEM AND IS HERE(Revised, added FILTERS )

 * 
MUST BE ADJUSTED ACCORDING DEVICE CURRENT AND MOSFET USED, THERE RESISTOR CAN MORE AND LESS FIT  
 * AN IRF520.
 * 
 * CIRCUITS NEED CAPACITORS AND GROUND RESISTORS TO MAKE LESS THAN 60 HRZ LOW PASS FILTER, OTHER RESISTOR TO 
 * GROUND BIG TO DISCHARGE THE SIGNAL. 
 * 
 * FOR EXAMPLE ONE RESISTOR 12K  TO SIGNAL IN (BATTERY AND DEVICES VOLTAGE) AND 47 uf capacitor and 
 * a 5.5K (with and adjust potenciometer small) to do a voltage divider 16/5. Capacitor is to ground 
 * in parallelto R2 of voltage divider. 
**THIS IS THE VOLTAGE DIVIDER CIRCUIT WITH A ZENER 5V AND A FUSE

*
 * ARDUINO IS CHARGING FROM THE BATTERY  USING AN LM 7805 OR 340 WHICH IS THE SIMPLEST OPTION.

OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS NEEDS LM315 TO SET IT TO 10 VOLTS OR 12 VOLTS.
 " 
 *THE MICROCONTROLLER SEND ALL THE DATA USING FIRMATA AND WITH PHYTON IS
 " HANDLED TO MAKE HISTORIAL OF INFO AND GRAPHICS WiTH ThINKER AND PYFIRMATA.
